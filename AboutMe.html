  <h2> About Mayank Srivastava</h2>
  <p>"The only way to know how strong you are is to keep testing your limits."<br>

    I am currently an undergraduate pursuing my B.Tech in School of Computer Science and Engineering at Galgotias University.
    I have a keen interest in coding and algorithms. I also like to work on software product and web development. I regularly
    increase my knowledge in these domains.<br>

    In my free time I like to read about news articles and current affairs.
    I also like to read and know more about historical events. Watching movies and TV series also constitute few of my hobbies.
    <br>
    At the end of the day I aspire to be the happiest, the most successful and best version of my self. </p>
